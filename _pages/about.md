I'm currently a 1st year PhD student at the University of Michigan studying statistics. I am interested in machine learning and its applications to computational biology.

I previously worked as a computer vision/graphics engineer at Facebook, where I worked on realtime dense 3D reconstruction (point clouds/KinectFusion) and dynamic real-time disocclusion on meshes. I previously worked on the software for the [Manifold camera](https://bkcabralwebsite.appspot.com/An-Integrated-6DoF-Video-Camera-and-System-Design.pdf), specifically adding support for rendering on cloud farms and improving the efficiency of the depth estimation algorithm. I also implemented, trained, and optimized (with layer fusion, SNPE, and QAT quantization) an end-to-end deep learning-based feature for Portal to run at realtime on the Snapdragon SoC.

I graduated as a Math major from Princeton in 2018 (certificates in CS and Statistics/ML). I also really enjoy lifting, biking, climbing, and reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83094203-yash-patel) and [papers](https://github.com/yashpatel5400/cool-papers). 

See my full (probably outdated) resume [here](http://yashpatel5400.github.io/files/resume.pdf). Some projects I have worked on (see other tabs for full lists):
